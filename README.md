# K-Means-Clustering-on-UK-gas-Data-Set
K-Means falls in the general category of clustering algorithms. Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning that tries to find structures in the data without using any labels or target values. Clustering partitions a set of observations into separate groupings such that an observation in a given group is more similar to another observation in the same group than to another observation in a different group. UKgas datset includes Quarterly UK gas consumption from 1960Q1 to 1986Q4, in millions of therms. UKgas dataset consists of 108 observations of 3 variables.
